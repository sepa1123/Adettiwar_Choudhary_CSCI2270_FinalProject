# Adettiwar_Choudhary_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Krishna Adettiwar and Tanay Choudhary will be working together for the CSCI 2270 Final Project. For our project, we are going to design and build a program for the customers of mailing services (FedEx, UPS, USPS, etc.). We are going to primarily be working with doubly linked lists. We are going to first build a network of cities in which each node of the linked list represents a city. Depending on how the customer wants to send his/her package, details about the shipment will be given by the program. The customer can choose whether to do ground shipping or 2-day air shipping, and depending on which option is chosen, the path the package will take to reach its destination will change. The cost services within the program will also change accordingly. The cost will be dependant on the shipping type and weight. The program can be accessed as the administrator of the company or a customer. The admin password is "12345" and through this the user can build a network, edit it by adding or deleting a city or completely change it. As a customer they can chose to search through nodes and returns the linked list. Theres also a support function that uses a random integer as the phone number for different cities.
